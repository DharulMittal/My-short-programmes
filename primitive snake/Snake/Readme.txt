- (Black) is your snake.
- (Red) is its food.
- (Blue) is an orb
- (Purple) is a poisonous berry.
- Navigate your snake towards the food by using arrow keys.
- Everytime you feed the snake, its length increases, and so 
  does your score.
- You can also collect orbs to gain abilities but beware of 
  the poisonous berries, which can and will kill your snake.
- Collecting 5 orbs unlocks one of the two abilities of the 
  snake: Invincibility or Slow Motion, both of which last for
  10 seconds each.
- Also, if the snake hits the walls or its own body, it will 
  die and the game will be over.
- Try to feed the snake as much as possible before it dies.

About-
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This game is our attempt at recreating the famous Snake game on Nokia that 
you most probably would've played (Ah, the nostalgia :P). Initially, this 
was going to be a very simple and bland replica of the original snake game
for our school project but we kept adding bits and bits of ectra stuff to it.
50-50 work was put into this by both of us.

  For the art design, we decided to give a calm retro 8-bit look to everything,
while also keeping them simplistic enough to not be a mess. The music we used
was also to support this 8-bit vibe.

  As for the game design, there's your basic snake game with an interactive 
main menu, pause screen and game over scrren, a 'how to play option for 
newbies, muting/unmuting music feature, orbs that give your snake abilities
and poisonous berries that'll kill your snake.
